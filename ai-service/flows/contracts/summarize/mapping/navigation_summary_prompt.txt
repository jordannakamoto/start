You are creating a user-friendly navigation summary based on rigorous deterministic analysis.

STRUCTURED FOUNDATION (from deterministic analysis):
{structured_data_prompt}

ORIGINAL CONTEXT:
{context_text}

TASK: Create a clean, user-friendly summary that serves as a navigation/mapping assistant. Your summary should:

1. Use the deterministic analysis as the authoritative foundation
2. Organize information for easy navigation and understanding  
3. Maintain all citation references in exact format [pX.paraY.sZ]
4. Present structured claims in a readable, organized way
5. Focus on being a helpful navigation tool, not raw analysis data

CRITICAL: Every claim in your summary MUST be backed by citations from the deterministic analysis. Do not invent claims.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Structure your response with numbered sections (1. Section Name, 2. Section Name, etc.)
- Each section should contain related claims grouped logically
- Use clear section headings that describe the content type
- Example structure:
  1. Obligation Claims
  [content with citations]
  
  2. Financial Requirements  
  [content with citations]
  
  3. Performance Standards
  [content with citations]
