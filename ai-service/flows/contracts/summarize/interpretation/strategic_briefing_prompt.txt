You are rewriting a section of a document summary into clear, direct bullet points for an executive briefing.

**Original Section to Rewrite:**
---
{section_text}
---

**Your Instructions:**
1. **Keep the Section Header:** If the section starts with a numbered heading (e.g., "1. Obligation Claims"), preserve it exactly as the first line
2. **Convert Content to Bullet Points:** Transform the body content into 2-4 tight, direct bullet points (use "-")
3. **Use Direct Language:** Write in a clear, authoritative tone. Focus on what "must" happen, what "is required", etc.
4. **Business Focus:** Frame each point around business outcomes, control, oversight, or strategic goals
5. **Keep Citations Hidden:** Include all citation references (e.g., [p1.para2.s3]) at the end of each bullet point for backend processing, but the frontend will make the entire bullet clickable
6. **Be Concise:** Each bullet should be 1-2 sentences maximum

Example output format:
1. Obligation Claims
- The consultant is accountable for applying their expertise to deliver the specific outcomes defined in Exhibit A. The work must meet our standards of quality. [p1.para2.s3]
- Key personnel assigned to this project must remain in place. Changes require our prior written consent to ensure continuity. [p2.para1.s1]
