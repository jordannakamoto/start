# Cognitive Canvas - High-Performance Architecture

## The Law of Invisibility (8ms Rule) Implementation

This architecture is designed around achieving sub-8ms response times for all user interactions, making the interface invisible through extreme performance.

## Core Pillars

### 1. GPU-First Rendering
- All text rendering hardware-accelerated via Canvas API
- Virtual viewport rendering for infinite document scrolling
- Optimized paint cycles with frame budgeting

### 2. Zero-Overhead Input Processing
- Direct input capture bypassing React event system
- Immediate visual feedback before state processing
- Input prediction and prefetching

### 3. Async-First Command System
- All heavy operations run in Web Workers
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Command queue with priority scheduling

## Performance Guarantees

1. **Input Latency**: < 2ms from keypress to visual feedback
2. **Document Load**: < 5ms for documents up to 10MB
3. **Tab Switch**: < 3ms for any document size
4. **Search**: < 8ms for 100k+ words with streaming results
5. **Auto-save**: Non-blocking, < 1ms perceived delay

## Feature Isolation Principles

Each feature is:
- **Self-contained**: No direct dependencies on other features
- **Async-first**: All operations non-blocking
- **Optimistic**: UI updates immediately, syncs in background
- **Measurable**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Testable**: Isolated unit and performance tests
